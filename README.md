Now i use latest version of Linux distribution ``Manjaro Xfce`` in my VM machine. I need it for some special software, for my education in the university.

In this lesson, I take one briliant command, this is `` git rebase ``. In my opinion, I will use these features in the future, because sometimes large number of commit in our "repo" make it difficult to read the `` git log ``.

In general, all the material in the lessons was clear. Most of the features I knew before.
